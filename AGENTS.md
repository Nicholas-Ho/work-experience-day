# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repository is a beginner-friendly playground for editing a single marketing webpage.

## Repo rules
- Keep the project static and simple.
- Main editable page is `index.html`.
- Do not add frameworks, build tools, package managers, or backend code.
- Do not rename or remove `index.html`.
- Do not change `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` unless explicitly asked.

## Change style
- Prefer small, visible changes (text, color, layout, font, spacing, images).
- Keep all changes beginner-readable.
- Avoid large refactors or multi-file rewrites.
- Keep deployment working on GitHub Pages after every change.

## Safety checks before finishing
- Confirm `index.html` still exists and is valid HTML.
- Confirm no new required dependencies were introduced.
- Confirm no secrets, tokens, or private data were added.

## If a request is risky
If asked to do something that may break the simple flow, suggest a smaller safe alternative first.
